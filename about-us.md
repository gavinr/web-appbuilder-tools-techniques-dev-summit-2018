Note: Gavin and I both work in Professional Services and do a lot of Web App Builder development.

Over the course of our work, our team has found a number of best practices and tools that work really well for us.
During this talk, we're going to share some of those more advanced workflows.  If you've been doing development in web app builder for awhile, we're hoping to help make your life as a developer easier and push you to take that next step in making your applications truly performant and production ready.  Even if you're brand new to the Web App Builder ecosystem, these tools and techniques going to be useful in planning new architectures, and getting off the ground.

Now, I'll pass it to Gavin to see where we've come since last year, and get us started.
